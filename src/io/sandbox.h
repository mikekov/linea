 * Inkscape::IO::Sandbox
 *
 * Utility functions for running Inkscape inside a "sandboxed" filesystem.
 * (on Linux: xdg-portal with snap or flatpak).
 *
 * Background: To isolate different applications against each other,
 * some newer packaging formats do not allow Inkscape direct access
 * to the user home directory or other paths. Instead, Inkscape can
 * only access special "magic paths" returned by the file-choose dialog.
 * This brings some issues:
 *
 * 1. The file chooser doesn't always return the true path on the host filesystem,
 *   but some replacement, e.g.
 *   /run/user/1000/doc/fe812a2/Foldername instead of /home/user/Documents/path/to/my/Foldername.
 *   We can access the file via the first path, but want to show the second one to the user.
 *
 * 2. If we have access to one file "/path/a.svg", we can't just access other files in the same folder.
 *   Automatically suggesting filenames, e.g. for export, is not possible anymore.
 *   Similarly, editing paths in a text entry widget is not possible anymore.
 *
